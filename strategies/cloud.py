# a strategy for gradual cloud adoption/migration

# we have a target
# we have a rate of progress
# other more complicated factors we can come back to later...

# of course rate of progress will change per app, but this is high-level/average
# each iteration(day) you get closer, eventually you are done

# 1% a day, so after 100 days all apps would be fully migrated
cloud_progress_rate = 1

# TODO incorporate randomness and variability to make for more realistic cloud progress
# TODO factor that cloud status into the carbon footprint
